## The Office 

- An American mockumentary sitcom television series that depicts the everyday lives of office employees.

- Met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but the following seasons, particularly those featuring Steve Carell, received significant acclaim from television critics.

- Later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing Carell's departure in season seven as a contributing factor. 

- The final season ended the series' run with a generally positive response.

- The `schrute` package contains a full transcript of every Office episode!

## Relational data

---

Itâ€™s rare that a data analysis involves only a single table of data. 

- Usually combine many tables of data to answer questions

- Multiple tables of data are called relational data.

---

For example, `raw_ratings` has one row per episode of The Office <br/> and contains the average IMDB rating.

```{r} 
raw_ratings
```

---

On the other hand, `raw_directors` has one row per writer for <br/> each episode and also specifies the episode's director.

```{r} 
raw_directors
```

---

Some problems:

- column names for episode titles are different in the two sets.

- not all of the episode names from `raw_ratings` are in `raw_directors`, and vice-versa.

  ```{r}
  all(raw_ratings$episode %in% raw_directors$episode_name)
  ```

- different units of observation in these two datasets.

You will get a chance to engage with these problems in class exercises.

For now, we will look at some simpler examples based on summaries of these data.

---

`ratings_byseason`: The mean rating of episodes, by season

```{r}

ratings_byseason <- raw_ratings %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarise(rating = weighted.mean(imdb_rating, total_votes))

ratings_byseason

```

---

`directors_byseason`: The most frequent director of each season

```{r}

directors_byseason <- raw_directors %>% select(-writer) %>% 
  distinct() %>% group_by(season) %>% count(director) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% slice(1) %>% select(-n)

directors_byseason

```

## Joining verbs

There are 3 families of verbs designed for relational data:

1. __Mutating joins__, which add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another.

1. __Filtering joins__, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.

1. __Set operations__, which treat observations as if they were set elements.

---

## Joining verbs

An example of __Mutating join:__

```{r, eval=FALSE}

ratings_byseason %>% #<<
  left_join(directors_byseason)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

ratings_byseason

```

## Left join

```{r, out.width='80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/left-join.gif')
```

---
## Right join
```{r, out.width='80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/right-join.gif')
```

---
## Semi join
```{r, out.width='80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/semi-join.gif')
```

---
## Anti join
```{r, out.width='80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/anti-join.gif')
```

---
## Full join
```{r, out.width='80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/full-join.gif')
```
